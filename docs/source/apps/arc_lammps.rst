**Introduction**

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronymfor Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has
potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and soft matter(biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be
used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator atthe atomic, meso, or continuum scale. LAMMPS runs on single processors or in
parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of thesimulation domain. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality.

The guide shows how to

- prepare a LAMMPS with a Python virtual environment and
- submit a test LAMMPS job.

To use LAMMPS you can either use the pre-installed modules or build your own Python virtual environment.

**Using the pre-installed versions of LAMMPS**:: 

   module spider LAMMPS 

        LAMMPS/3Mar2020-foss-2020a-Python-3.8.2-kokkos-QUIP
        LAMMPS/3Mar2020-foss-2020a-Python-3.8.2-kokkos
        LAMMPS/23Jun2022-foss-2021b-kokkos-CUDA-11.4.1
        LAMMPS/23Jun2022-foss-2021b-kokkos

And load the appropriate version. For example:: 

        module load LAMMPS/3Mar2020-foss-2020a-Python-3.8.2-kokkos

The above will load LAMMPS into your environment, and the package will be available from within Python.

**Setting up your own virtual environment (Python 3)**

First ensure you are using an interactive session on a compute node::
   
   srun -p interactive --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash

We have a set of build scripts which you can use to build LAMMPS with most of the packages, and its own Anaconda 3 environment. To obtain a copy of these scripts::

  cd $DATA
  mkdir scripts ; cd scripts
  cp -r /apps/common/examples/LAMMPS/2022.06/* .

By default our build script will create the following directories::
  
  $DATA/LAMMPS-env    (Python environment and installation location)
  $DATA/LAMMPS-build  (Build files)
  
If you would like to use different directories, you will need to change the ``$DATA/scripts/LAMMPS-config.sh`` file. Specifically the following two lines::

  export LAMMPS_INSTALL=$DATA/LAMMPS-env
  export LAMMPS_BUILD=$DATA/LAMMPS-build
  
To run the build of LAMMPS::

  cd $DATA/scripts
  sh LAMMPS-build.sh
  
Once the build completes you can test the LAMMPS build by submitting the test job in the ``scripts`` folder as follows::

  cd $DATA/scripts
  sbatch LAMMPS-test.sh
  
The output in the generated SLURM file ``slurm-nnnnnn.out`` should include the following information::
