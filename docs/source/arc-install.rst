Installing your own software
============================

Licensed Software (Commercial or Restricted Use)
------------------------------------------------

There are a number of licensed commercial or restricted use applicationsl already installed on ARC. See our `Restricted Licence Software Applications Form <https://www.arc.ox.ac.uk/restricted-licence-software-applications>`_
for a list.


We can help you install new applications of this type by hosting them centrally and restricting access by project, or you can install them yourself in your
``$DATA`` area following the installation guides provided by the software vendor.

.. warning::

  Do not attempt to run package managers such as ``apt`` or ``yum`` on the ARC systems these will **not** work as they will (by default) attempt to install code into
  protected system directories which you do not have permission to write to. 
  
  If you have such requirements, contact the ARC team via support@arc.ox.ac.uk
