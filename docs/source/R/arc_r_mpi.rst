Using Rmpi on ARC
-----------------

Example Rmpi script for SLURM
 
The following is a brief example of how to run an Rmpi script on SLURM. This example uses the latest R version R/4.4.0-gfbf-2023a
 
Create the following script and save it as ``Rmpi-test.R``::
 
  #
  # Rmpi test
  #
  library("Rmpi")
  
  # Spawn (size-1) slaves, one being resevered for master.
  #
  size <- mpi.universe.size()
  mpi.spawn.Rslaves(nslaves = size - 1)

  # Identify each slave process and display a message
  #
  mpi.bcast.cmd(rank <- mpi.comm.rank())
  mpi.bcast.cmd(size <- mpi.comm.size())
  mpi.bcast.cmd(hostname <- mpi.get.processor.name())
  mpi.remote.exec(paste("This is rank", rank, "of", size, "running on node: ", hostname))

  # Close all slaves and finish
  #
  mpi.close.Rslaves(dellog = FALSE)
  mpi.quit()
 
Now create a submission script called ``submit.sh`` containing the following lines::
 
  #! /bin/bash

  #SBATCH --job-name=mpi-test
  #SBATCH --time=00:10:00
  #SBATCH --nodes=2
  #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
  #SBATCH --output=rmpi.out
  #SBATCH --partition=devel

  module load R/4.4.0-gfbf-2023a
  mpirun -np 1 R --vanilla -f Rmpi-test.R
  rm *.log
 
The script above requests at total of 16 processes, where 8 are run on each of 2 nodes. The job is sent to the ``devel`` partition 
(hence maximum 10 minute run time) and the job output is sent to a file named ``rmpi.out``
 
To submit this job, use the command::
 
  sbatch submit.sh
 
After a few minutes the job should complete and a file named ``rmpi.out`` should be created in the
submission directory, this should contain the following output::
 

  $ cat rmpi.out

          15 slaves are spawned successfully. 0 failed.
  master  (rank 0 , comm 1) of size 16 is running on: arc-c266
  slave1  (rank 1 , comm 1) of size 16 is running on: arc-c266
  slave2  (rank 2 , comm 1) of size 16 is running on: arc-c266

  ... ... ...
  slave14 (rank 14, comm 1) of size 16 is running on: arc-c267

  $slave1
  [1] "This is rank 1 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave2
  [1] "This is rank 2 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave3
  [1] "This is rank 3 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave4
  [1] "This is rank 4 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave5
  [1] "This is rank 5 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"

  [1] "This is rank 6 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave7
  [1] "This is rank 7 of 16 running on node:  arc-c266"
  $slave8
  [1] "This is rank 8 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave9
  [1] "This is rank 9 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave10
  [1] "This is rank 10 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave11
  [1] "This is rank 11 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave12
  [1] "This is rank 12 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave13
  [1] "This is rank 13 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave14
  [1] "This is rank 14 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"
  $slave15
  [1] "This is rank 15 of 16 running on node:  arc-c267"

  [1] 1
  > mpi.quit()
 
From the above output you can see the slave processes ran correctly with a total of 16 processes across two ARC compute nodes.
